This article demonstrates how to enable and use Geo-blocking on Pfsense. The Geo-blocking data is being synced from [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/ip-geolocation-databases-api-services). MixMind is a third-party provider.

The Pfblocker-NG plugin allows for adding BGP autonomous system numbers and/or GeoIP contents to access control rules. Access control is simply the process of controlling access from or to a specific set of layer 3 and/or layer 4 addresses (IPs and ports).

# Technical Procedure:

## Installing Geo-Blocking Plugin:

## Sign up for a Maxmind account:

This is the registration link: [https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup)

### Generate a new license key:

After you sign up, you will need to generate a new license key to allow your firewall to fetch the geo files automatically.

You need to copy this key so that you paste it into Pfsense:

> [!warning]
> You won't be able to see this key again after you return to main menu. Make sure to copy it now and paste it into Notepad ðŸ˜‰.

After scrolling down as instructed in the previous screenshot add the license key you got from the mixmind website here:

Set the following settings and make sure to hit the save button in the bottom right of the screenshot:

Now you need to specify what countries you want to allow in each region (I am going to show you North America as an example):

# Create a firewall rule with Geo-blocking object:

You will start to see the geo location aliases auto complete their names as you type:

You can set the Geo location alias as the source or destination in your rule and you have just implemented Geo blocking on Pfsense ðŸ˜Š.
