# About This Website:

> [!Note]
> I am still in the process of publishing contents from Obsidian to this website.

This website is mostly a way for me to share my documentation out of Obsidian on the web through GitHub pages ðŸ™‚.

You might be wondering why the name of this website is `diyaagrams.com`? I love diagrams and some of my diagrams have been called "diyaagrams" a few times. Therefore, I thought it would be a good idea for me to publish my "diyaagrams" on `diyaagrams.com` ðŸ˜‰.

## Site Components Layout:

> [!Note]
> Some of the folders are still empty as I haven't published notes to them yet.

The "Site Directory:" section at the bottom of the page is the best way to see all the contents of this site. Scroll to the bottom of the page to see the section with the title "Site Directory:".

## Obsidian Offline Vault:

This screenshot above shows how many notes I have in my offline Obsidian notes ðŸ˜Š. My goal is to publish most of the contents in that vault on this website.
