# About This Website:

> [!Note]
> I am still in the process of publishing contents from Obsidian to this website.

This website is mostly a way for me to share my documentation out of Obsidian on the web through GitHub pages ðŸ™‚.

You might be wondering why the name of this website is `diyaagrams.com`? I love diagrams and some of my diagrams have been called "diyaagrams" a few times. Therefore, I thought it would be a good idea for me to publish my "diyaagrams" on `diyaagrams.com` ðŸ˜‰.

## Site Components Layout:

> [!Note]
> Some of the folders are still empty as I haven't published notes to them yet.

## Obsidian Offline Vault:

This screenshot above shows how many notes I have in my offline Obsidian notes ðŸ˜Š. My goal is to publish most of the contents in that vault on this website.

# About Me:

My name is Diyaa Alkanakre. I graduated from the Network Engineering Technology ([NET](https://www.nait.ca/programs/network-engineering-technology)) program at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology ([NAIT](https://www.nait.ca/)) in 2023. I fell in love with routing after attending the classes of [Scott Empson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottempson/), [Monica Ciobanu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/monica-ciobanu-61649517/), and Terry Pearce at NAIT.


I like to spend majority of my personal time making network infrastructure diagrams and technical documentation like the article you are reading right now. I am able to make large scale networks at home thanks to [Proxmox virtual environment](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview).
