# About This Website:

This website is mostly a way for me to share my documentation out of Obsidian on the web through GitHub pages ðŸ™‚.

You might be wondering why the name of this website is `diyaagrams.com`? I love diagrams and some of my diagrams have been called "diyaagrams" a few times. Therefore, I thought it would be a good idea for me to publish my "diyaagrams" on `diyaagrams.com` ðŸ˜‰.

## Site Components Layout:

The explorer section on the right hand side under the graph view is the best way to see all the contents of this site on desktop devices. The explorer view can be found in the bottom right section on mobile devices.

## Site Pages Layout:

> [!Note]
> If a folder does not appear in the explorer view, it is likely because the folder does not exist yet.
